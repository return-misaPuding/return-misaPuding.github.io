# Math term calculator
This is a simple calculator that parses a given term and simplifies it (if the term is a fraction).
It can also substitute variables to calculate the result
You can add exponents to variables (though not numbers). You can create a fraction with /, though there is no support for nested fractions.
Variables (limited to 1 character) can be substituted with `variable=value`, separated with commas.
